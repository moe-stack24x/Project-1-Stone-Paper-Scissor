# 🪨📄✂️ Stone-Paper-Scissor Game

A classic **Stone-Paper-Scissor** game developed in C++! This project was built to apply fundamental programming concepts and create a structured, interactive console game.

## 🌟 Game Features
* **Round System:** You can decide how many rounds to play (1 to 10).
* **Smart AI:** The computer selects its move completely randomly using `rand()` to ensure fairness.
* **Visual Feedback:** The screen changes color based on the round result (Green for Win, Red for Loss, Yellow for Draw).
* **Final Report:** A detailed summary is displayed at the end, showing total Wins, Losses, and Draws.
* **Replayability:** You can start a new game immediately without restarting the program.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts Applied:**
    * Functional Programming (Modular structure).
    * Loops & Control Structures (For/While, If/Switch).
    * Random Number Generation (`rand()` & `srand()`).
    * Console Color Manipulation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the project files.
2. Open `Stone-Paper-Scissor.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Press `Ctrl + F5` to run and enjoy!
